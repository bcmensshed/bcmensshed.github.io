#### Salmo Men's Shed teaches home-school youth to Weld

In the Summer of 2020 the Salmo Men's Shed received funds to promote the sharing
of trades skills in the community.
Focus was on school aged youth and especially home-schooled / remote learning kids 
that do not neccessarily have access to traditional school district workshop opportunities.
Our local Salmo based board member Mike Adkins undertook the task of teaching the
program which is now well underway which includes traditional welding techniques and 
the use of tools in that trade such as a forge, arc and TIG processes.
